# React Password Generator

React Password Generator is a demo React application that generates strong, random passwords based on user input parameters. The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how to write clean, modular, and testable React code.

## Installation

To install and run the React Password Generator on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-password-generator.git`.

2. Navigate to the project directory using the command `cd react-password-generator`.

3. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`.

4. Start the application by running `npm start`.

5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, users can enter the desired length of the password and choose which types of characters to include (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or symbols). Clicking the "Generate Password" button will then generate a strong, random password based on the input parameters.

## Code Structure

The code for the React Password Generator is structured in a clean, modular, and testable way. The main components of the application are:

- `App.js`: This is the main component that renders the entire application.

- `PasswordGenerator.js`: This is the component that generates the password based on the user input parameters.

- `PasswordForm.js`: This is the component that displays the form where users can enter the password parameters.

- `PasswordDisplay.js`: This is the component that displays the generated password.

- `Password.test.js`: This is the test file for the PasswordGenerator component.

The application also includes several helper functions for generating the password and validating user input.

## Testing

The React Password Generator includes unit tests for the `PasswordGenerator` component. To run the tests, use the command `npm test`.
